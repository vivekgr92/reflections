When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use, the remote repository when I want to share the code with everyone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Its because,it gives us more control in what changes should be made on out local branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used when we need to clone the repository which is in github to our github account without the need for cloning it into the local
system
Clones are used to copy the repository into the local machine
branches are used when we want to experiment something like adding a new feature or changing some values, which should not affect the master
branch
